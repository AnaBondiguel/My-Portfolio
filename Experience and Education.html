        <p class="paragraph">Thesis Title: “The Role of Intuitive and Analytic Decision-Making in Entrepreneurial Opportunity Recognition”
          <br>
          The purpose of this thesis was to examine how entrepreneurial firms combine the use of intuitive and analytical decision-making in opportunity recognition. It was a multiple-case study using an interpretive paradigm. Forty-eight interviews were conducted in eight software companies, and analysed by comparing founders’ and managers’ decision-making process. The grounded theoretical model of dynamic intuitive-analytic capabilities extends the literatures of dynamic capabilities, intuition, product innovation, and entrepreneurial opportunity, and helps to answer one of the most commonly asked questions in the field of entrepreneurship: why some entrepreneurial companies are more successful than others.

          "Internationalization Process of New Zealand’s Software Born-Global Companies"
          <br>
          The thesis focuses on how New Zealand’s software firms engage in overseas export activities, and what exporting strategies they use to be successful. The study develops a theoretical model of New Zealand’s software born-global companies’ internationalization process. The model makes contributions to the theoretical concepts – born-global, psychic distance, and global mindset and also recommendations to New Zealand’s government policies.
